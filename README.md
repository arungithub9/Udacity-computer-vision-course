### Program outline:

**This Nanodegree program is broken into three main sections:**

**1. Facial Keypoint Detection** : Use image processing techniques and deep learning techniques to detect faces in an image and find facial keypoints, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.

The system consists of a face detector that uses Haar Cascades and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that predict the facial keypoints in the detected faces. The facial keypoint detection system takes in any image with faces and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face.

Some results from part 1:

**2. Image Captioning** : Train a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image. Mainly about advances in deep learning architectures like region-based CNN's, YOLO and single-shot detection algorithms, and CNN's used in combination with recurrent neural networks.

3- Project: Landmark Detection & Tracking (SLAM): Implementing SLAM, a robust method for tracking an object over time and mapping out its surrounding environment, using elements of probability, motion models, and linear algebra.
